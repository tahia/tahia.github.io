In a broad sense, my interest lies in studying how local populations adapt across different ecological clines and variable environments. At the molecular level, I focus on studying gene expression divergence and how cis-and trans-regulation can play key roles on adaptation. In my dissertation research, I combined various quantitative genetics, population genomics and functional genomic approces to study the genetics and molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic divergence in Panicum grasses. Currently I am working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the
[Department of Ecology and Evolutionionary Biology](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb)
, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor with [Wittkopp Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/wittkopp-lab/). In general, our lab investigates the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution. In Wittkopp Lab by leveraging from the existing resources of natural and artificial regulatory variants in yeast, I study the effects of these mutations on expression plasticity and fitness in response to environmental heterogeneity.
